{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\n","# Problem Overview\n","\n","The project focuses on document similarity using language models to identify the most relevant document or sentence based on a given input text. This is particularly useful in plagiarism detection, information retrieval, and semantic search applications. Our team focused on exploring various methods for identifying semantic similarity between sentences. We experimented with multiple approaches to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of similarity detection:\n","\n","## Chosen Solution: Using BERT for Document Similarity\n","\n","To address the document similarity task, we propose using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT’s contextual embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text by understanding the relationships between words in a sentence. We leverage pre-trained BERT models and fine-tune them for our specific task of document similarity.\n","\n","### Why BERT?\n","\n","1.\tContextual Understanding: Unlike traditional word embeddings like Word2Vec, BERT captures the contextual meaning of words based on the entire sentence.\n","2.\tBidirectional Encoding: BERT reads text in both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left), improving the quality of embeddings.\n","3.\tFlexibility: Pre-trained on massive datasets, BERT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks with minimal labeled data.\n","\n","### **BERT Embeddings for Semantic Similarity**\n","\n","- We started by generating embeddings using the basic BERT model and calculating similarity scores between sentences based on these embeddings\n","    \n","### **Text Summarization and Similarity Analysis**\n","\n","- Next, we incorporated a combination of BART (for text summarization) and BERT (for embedding generation) to explore sentence similarity between summarized texts.\n","    \n","### **BERT Classification Model**\n","\n","- Finally, we trained a BERT-based classification model to predict similarity labels (\"similar\" or \"not similar\") for sentence pairs.\n","\n","### **Datasets Used**\n","\n","**Synthetic Dataset**\n","\n","- We generated a custom dataset stored in the Synthetic folder. This dataset includes original and paraphrased sentence pairs derived from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.\n","\n","**STS Benchmark Dataset**\n","\n","- The STS Benchmark dataset was used to train our BERT classification model for predicting sentence similarity.\n","\n","

To achieve this, we implemented an efficient and streamlined inference pipeline, ensuring that the model could evaluate the similarity between two sentences with minimal computational overhead. And here we are tokenizing a pair of sentences, pass them through the trained model. Finally, computing probabilities and predicting the class (\"**similar**\" or \"**not similar**\")."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T04:52:15.309854Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T04:52:15.309504Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T04:52:15.316280Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T04:52:15.315319Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T04:52:15.309822Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import torch\n","\n","from transformers import (\n","    BertTokenizer,\n","    BertForSequenceClassification,\n","    Trainer,\n","    TrainingArguments,\n",")\n","\n","\n","def predict(sentence1, sentence2, model, tokenizer, device, max_length=128):\n","    # Tokenize the input\n","    inputs = tokenizer(\n","        sentence1,\n","        sentence2,\n","        padding=\"max_length\",\n","        truncation=True,\n","        max_length=max_length,\n","        return_tensors=\"pt\",\n","    ).to(\n","        device\n","    )  # Move inputs to the same device as the model\n","\n","    # Run the model\n","    with torch.no_grad():\n","        outputs = model(\n","            input_ids=inputs[\"input_ids\"],\n","            attention_mask=inputs[\"attention_mask\"],\n","        )\n","\n","        logits = outputs.logits\n","\n","    # Apply softmax to get probabilities\n","    probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)\n","    predicted_class = torch.argmax(probs).item()\n","\n","    return predicted_class, probs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["labels = [\"not similar\", \"similar\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T04:52:23.215748Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T04:52:23.214799Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T04:52:23.227716Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T04:52:23.226789Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T04:52:23.215709Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["BertForSequenceClassification(\n","  (bert): BertModel(\n","    (embeddings): BertEmbeddings(\n","      (word_embeddings): Embedding(30522, 768, padding_idx=0)\n","      (position_embeddings): Embedding(512, 768)\n","      (token_type_embeddings): Embedding(2, 768)\n","      (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)\n","      (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n","    )\n","    (encoder): BertEncoder(\n","      (layer): ModuleList(\n","        (0-11): 12 x BertLayer(\n","          (attention): BertAttention(\n","            (self): BertSdpaSelfAttention(\n","              (query): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n","              (key): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n","              (value): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n","              (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n","            )\n","            (output): BertSelfOutput(\n","              (dense): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n","              (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)\n","              (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n","            )\n","          )\n","          (intermediate): BertIntermediate(\n","            (dense): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=3072, bias=True)\n","            (intermediate_act_fn): GELUActivation()\n","          )\n","          (output): BertOutput(\n","            (dense): Linear(in_features=3072, out_features=768, bias=True)\n","            (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)\n","            (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n","          )\n","        )\n","      )\n","    )\n","    (pooler): BertPooler(\n","      (dense): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)\n","      (activation): Tanh()\n","    )\n","  )\n","  (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)\n","  (classifier): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=2, bias=True)\n",")"]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["device = torch.device(\n","    \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n",")  # using gpu if available\n","model.to(device)  # Move the model to the selected device\n","model.eval()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Sentence example and prediction**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### Finally, the model outputs both the predicted class and the probabilities for each class.
